# Going with PHP 🎓

The first part of an ongoing series where I document my journey in learning new programming languages by writing byte-sized notes about the topics and concepts that I learn.

Here, I write about the **[PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP)](https://www.php.net/)** language.

## What is PHP?

PHP is a **server-side scripting language** that is geared towards web development.

- Being an interpreted server-side language, PHP code does not have to be compiled
- Can be written alongside HTML within PHP tags `<?php ?>`
- Often used with relational databases such as MySQL
- Relatively easy to learn

## How PHP works

The PHP code you write is not processed client-side. It is processed by the server

1. Browser sends a request to the server
2. PHP code is processed
3. Server sends back processed HTML to the browser

## Setting Up a PHP Environment

I started learning PHP by using the **[XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)** package.

**XAMPP** is a software suite that makes it easy to start using PHP to develop websites and applications on your local machine. Get it **[here](https://www.apachefriends.org/)**
